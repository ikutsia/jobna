# Netlify Deployment Fix

## Problem
Deployment was failing because Netlify Functions needed their own dependencies installed.

## Solution

### 1. Created `functions/package.json`
Added required dependencies for Netlify Functions:
- `@google/generative-ai` - For Gemini AI integration
- `openai` - For OpenAI integration (hybrid functions)

### 2. Updated `netlify.toml`
Modified the build command to install function dependencies first:
```toml
command = "cd functions && npm install && cd .. && npm run build"
```

### 3. Added `functions/.gitignore`
To exclude `node_modules` from version control.

## Deployment Steps

1. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment - add function dependencies"
   git push
   ```

2. Netlify will automatically:
   - Install function dependencies
   - Build the React app
   - Deploy everything

## Verification

After deployment, test the functions:
- Visit: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/test-gemini`

This should return a success response if Gemini API is configured correctly.
