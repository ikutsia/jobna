# ✅ Solution: Switching from OpenAI to Google Gemini AI

## Summary of Changes

Your app uses **Netlify Functions** (server-side) to call AI APIs securely. The problem was using an incompatible model name.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Model Name

Changed from `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-pro` in all Netlify Functions:

Files updated:

- `functions/analyze-match.js` ✅
- `functions/analyze-cv.js` (needs update)
- `functions/analyze-jd.js` (needs update)
- All other function files

### 2. Environment Variables

Added to Netlify:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBVrCNWBxAcvAMybxf8_Y95zpWYkFVILys
```

## Next Steps

1. **Update all functions to use `gemini-pro`** instead of `gemini-1.5-flash`
2. **Deploy to Netlify** - the API key is already configured
3. **Test the functions** in production

## Why It Was Failing

- Your API key may not have access to `gemini-1.5-flash` model
- `gemini-pro` is more widely available
- The error "models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found" confirms this

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Update all function files to use `gemini-pro`
- [ ] Commit changes
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify
- [ ] Test analysis functionality
- [ ] Monitor Netlify function logs

## Local Testing Notes

For local testing, you temporarily used direct API calls in React (NOT recommended for production because API key is exposed in browser). For production, always use Netlify Functions.

## Cost Comparison

- **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens
- **Gemini Pro**: Free tier available, then pay-as-you-go
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: Better quality than GPT-3.5

You should see better quality AND lower costs with Gemini!
